# leetCode

This is a repository of solutions with explanations for the leet code problems I've solved in my time preparing for technical interviews.
Not all solutions are optimized and run at 90% faster speed but hopefully they can help someone who is also undertaking this difficult task.

Solutions are broken down into the three leetcode categories of Easy, Medium, Hard. So far I've only really worked on easy problems but hopefully this repository will be full of problems of all difficulties.
